using the file named {project}_{feature}.md 
fully implement this feature end-to-end until it is functional, covering all
required layers (UI, business logic, database, file access, etc.). For each step,
proceed as follows:
- For all business logic related to a feature, develop it within a dedicated
/{project}_{feature} directory.
- Plan each phase in detail, including design, unit testing, integration testing,
and acceptance criteria.
- Choose the order of execution to facilitate integration.
- Write acceptance tests before you write code, which we'll use to validate the
implemenation.
- Generate behavior-driven development scenarios in given-when-then format that
trace directly back to your users stories and acceptance criteria.
- Create test datasets that systematically exercise boundary conditions, edge
cases, and error scenarios
- Generate comprehensive regression test suites whenever you modify existing
functionality.
- For each function, first write unit tests to achieve at least 60% test coverage.
Then, implement the function. Run the tests, fix any failing cases if necessary,
and only then proceed to the next function.
- After each completed step and after each integration phase, pause and request my
validation before proceeding.
- Apply all prescribed rules and best practices at each stage.
- Document every step in a file named todolist-{project}-{feature}.md. Only mark
steps as validated after I have explicitly confirmed them.
