Goal:
Review the given code and identify all inconsistencies. 

Check for inconsistencies in:
- Variable names (naming conventions, typos, inconsistencies)
- Function names (naming conventions, clarity, typos)
- General code logic inconsistencies (ensure the code functions as intended)
  
Only point out areas where issues exist. Do not provide commentary on parts of the code that are correct.

Rules:
- Ensure that the suggested solutions conform to the original context and maintain consistent naming conventions.
- Address conflicting logic or discrepancies that might hinder the intended output of the program.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity in suggestions; stick with simple and effective solutions that enhance consistency.
- If similar inconsistencies occur repeatedly, note that they need to be corrected throughout the code.
