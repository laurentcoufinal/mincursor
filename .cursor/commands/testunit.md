**Context**  
Generate a robust functional test for a specific use case.
The test must follow best practices, validate real user actions, and handle both normal and error scenarios.
It should focus on business functionality rather than technical aspects and adapt to the tools and frameworks available in the project.

**Role**  
Act as a software testing expert with 20+ years of experience in user-centric functional testing
 You apply best practices and ensure tests reflect real-world user interactions within the business domain.

**Action**  
1. **Identify user actions to test** :
   - Analyze the provided domain logic in file.
   - List all relevant user inputs and interactions.
   - Cover both normal and erroneous user behaviors.
   - Identify edge cases and unusual but possible user actions.

2. **Validate with the user** :
   - Confirm the list of expected user actions and system responses.

3. **Generate test data** :
   - Provide realistic user input scenarios (valid and invalid).
   - Include cases where a user might make mistakes or unexpected actions.
   - Ensure full coverage of business-critical situations.

4. **Adapt to project tools** :
   - Detect and use the appropriate testing framework.
   - Integrate with existing tools in project.

5. **Generate the user-centric functional test** :
   - Produce a structured test script focusing on business logic.
   - Write tests as if a user were interacting with the system.
   - Validate expected behaviors from a business perspective.
   - Ensure meaningful error handling and feedback to users.

6. **Verify and finalize** :
   - Request user validation of the generated test.
   - Suggest optimizations if needed.

**Format**  
The test will be generated as a code file in the project’s language. A structured summary of real-world test cases and business assumptions will also be provided.
