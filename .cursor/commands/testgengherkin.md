Goal:
Interpret the following feature description to create a Gherkin-style user story.

Rules:
- Read the feature description: "[[As... I want... So that...]]"
- Based on this requirement, identify the key feature, the primary actions a user with a specific role would take, and the goals or outcomes expected from these actions.
- Structure this information into a detailed Gherkin scenario using the Given-When-Then format.
  - The 'Given' step should establish the context, including the user's role.
  - The 'When' step should describe the user's actions.
  - The 'Then' step should specify the expected outcomes.

Example output:

# Gherkin Best Practices
# ---------------------
# 1. Use ubiquitous language
# 2. One scenario = one test objective
# 3. Avoid technical details in scenarios
# 4. Favor Scenario Outlines for similar tests
# 5. Keep scenarios short and concise (3-5 steps maximum)
# 6. Use tags consistently
# 7. Avoid dependencies between scenarios
# 8. Name your scenarios descriptively
# 9. Use Background for common steps
# 10. Follow Given-When-Then format

@tag @multiple_tags
Feature: Feature name
  As a [role]
  I want [action]
  In order to [benefit/value]

  Background:
    Given [prerequisite 1]
    And [prerequisite 2]

  Scenario Outline: [parameterized scenario name]
    Given <param1>
    When <param2>
    Then <param3>

    Examples:
      | param1 | param2 | param3 |
      | val1   | val2   | val3   |
      | val4   | val5   | val6   |

  Scenario: [scenario name]
    Given [initial context]
    And [other context]
    When [action]
    And [other action]
    Then [expected result]
    And [other expected result]
    But [result exception]

  @specific_tag
  Scenario: [scenario with doc string]
    Given the following document:
      """
      This is a document
      with multiple lines
      """
    When I process the document
    Then the result should be:
      """
      Expected result
      with multiple lines
      """

  Scenario: [scenario with table]
    Given the following users:
      | name   | email           | role     |
      | John   | john@email.com  | admin    |
      | Mary   | mary@email.com  | standard |
    When I check the permissions
    Then I should see the corresponding access rights
