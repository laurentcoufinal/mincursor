# cahier-des-charges
Reformulate all project requirements using clear, precise questions to clarify
every aspect necessary for a production-grade solution.
- Translate all requirements and clarifications into English, following best prompt
engineering practices to ensure unambiguous, comprehensive, and actionable
instructions.
- For every framework you select, clearly explain the reasons behind your choice
using precise, objective criteria and contextual justification in English.
- Decompose each requirement into clear, fully implementable, and self-contained
features or units of work. For every feature, specify in English which frameworks
will be used, along with a precise, objective justification for each selection
based on project goals, context, and technical criteria.
- Document the finalized list of all project requirements and decisions in a
dedicated file named CDC{project}.md.
