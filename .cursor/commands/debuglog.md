Goal:
Add logging messages to the given code at each significant step.

Rules:
- Use an appropriate emoji at the start of each log message for better visualization.
- Annotate the code by adding logging messages at each significant step, including within inner functions.
- Each log message must use a suitable emoji representing the step it corresponds to— for instance:
  - 🛠️ **Action Step** (When a particular action is being performed)
  - ✅ **Confirmation Step** (Verifying or completing an action)
  - 🔄 **Calling Function** (Log inner function calls)
  - ⚠️ **Handling Errors** (If logging at the point of error handling)
- Each message must be descriptive to help in easy debugging of errors.
- Ensure loggings are descriptive enough to aid in debugging but not too verbose as to overwhelm output.
- Log points should include function calls, iteration starts, important decisions, error handling, and final steps.
- The focus should be on enhancing clarity without compromising code functionality.Goal:
Review the given code and identify all inconsistencies. 

Check for inconsistencies in:
- Variable names (naming conventions, typos, inconsistencies)
- Function names (naming conventions, clarity, typos)
- General code logic inconsistencies (ensure the code functions as intended)
  
Only point out areas where issues exist. Do not provide commentary on parts of the code that are correct.

Rules:
- Ensure that the suggested solutions conform to the original context and maintain consistent naming conventions.
- Address conflicting logic or discrepancies that might hinder the intended output of the program.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity in suggestions; stick with simple and effective solutions that enhance consistency.
- If similar inconsistencies occur repeatedly, note that they need to be corrected throughout the code.
