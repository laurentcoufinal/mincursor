Plan each step clearly: design, development, unit testing, integration testing, and
acceptance. Choose the order of execution to make integration testing easier. After
each completed step (UI, business logic, database access, file access, etc.) and
after each integration phase, ask me for validation.
Apply all relevant rules at every stage. Record each step in a `todolist-{project}-
{feature}.md` file, and mark each step as validated after my confirmation.
For each phase, launch as many agents as possible to parallelize progress. Closely
review their work to ensure strict compliance with design standards. If deviations
are found, request corrections—allow up to two iterations. After corrections,
request my validation.
Log all steps in a `todolist-{project}.md` file and only mark steps as complete
after explicit validation from me.
